                                    <p>Most ERPs are a general ledger, so they are essentially limited to receiving and storing information within the four walls of the company. In other words, they can collect and send information to and from network partners – such as suppliers, warehouses, and carriers
– but have no other functionality for processing, analyzing, or optimizing that data. Static systems such as these with fixed business rules are no longer enough to handle the complex demands and challenges of the modern supply chain.

Find out exactly what control you will have over information access for the various departments. Who will be able to upload data, which data will be accessible, what security levels are available? Find out what limitations are in place and how they can be adjusted to suit your company’s needs.<br /> Remember that you know your organisation and its needs better than anyone. Use this as a guideline to develop questions that will cover all your logistics’ requirements, ensuring you get the best out of your Transport Management System.<br /> It is vitally important to partner with a transport management software company that understands your business and has the ability to ease the pressure and not create more.</p>
